# CRAZY AS HELL

Experience the feeling of making mischief in hell by competing with your rival to see who is the best demon around.

Crazy as Hell is a race game where two players are needed. One will take his hands on the wheel while trying to survive the attacks of his opponent, this one will create fancy traps to end the life of the car.

This is a game being developed by students from <a href="https://www.imagecampus.edu.ar/">Image Campus</a>
